After working with my Raspberry Pi and Monero “Bitcoin” mining (thank you tom’s hardware), last night I completed a second technology exploring project. I set up and tested my new Arduino lie detector or more accurately my new impedance pneumographic monitor (thank you electro peak)...

Both pieces of technology seem to be particularly useful for learning and exploring technology.
